I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world.

AdSphere büyük çapte e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu, yani teknik olarak hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu demek oluyordu ki, şuan başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideyiz. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu, yani teknik olarak hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu demek oluyordu ki, şuan başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideyiz. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu, yani teknik olarak hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu demek oluyordu ki, şuan başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideyiz. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu.

Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu hatırlatmak isterim ki bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu, yani teknik olarak hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu demek oluyordu ki, şuan başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideyiz. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu hatırlatmak isterim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günü deployment günümüz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu, yani teknik olarak hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu demek oluyordu ki, şuan başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideyiz. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu hatırlatmak isterim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler.

Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık.

Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu hatırlatmak isterim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günü \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günümüz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu hatırlatmak isterim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmek isterim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir promptu Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık.

Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\n^HOH8, yani hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\n*HOH8, yani hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara.* ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde bunun ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumcuları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki bir canlı yayında Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken artık Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu.

Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık.

Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nHOH8, yani \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo;.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Arayüzmüş, Figma\u0026rsquo;ymış haftalar harcadık ve neredeyse hiç ilerleyemedik.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz arayüzü ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç arayüz yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo; ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri unutmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Arayüzmüş, Figma\u0026rsquo;ymış haftalar harcadık ve neredeyse hiç ilerleyemedik.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz arayüzü ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç arayüz yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı.

İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim.

Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Haftaya Gorusmek Uzere: Campaign Definition + Pooling Giriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme Merhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum? AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Arayüzmüş, Figma\u0026rsquo;ymış haftalar harcadık ve neredeyse hiç ilerleyemedik.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz arayüzü ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç arayüz yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-tldr\"\u003e💡 TL;DR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu devlog\u0026rsquo;lar??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdSphere neyi amacliyor?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopmenta geciste Neden oyalandik?

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Sonra ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Arayüzmüş, Figma\u0026rsquo;ymış haftalar harcadık ve neredeyse hiç ilerleyemedik.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz arayüzü ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç arayüz yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumnu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"giriş-ve-kısa-bilgilendirme\"\u003eGiriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"merhaba-nedir-bu-devloglar-ve-neden-bu-yazıyı-yazıyorum\"\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu.

Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüoyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatsaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Şuanda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın her neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu farkettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İremle birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İremle Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu ortasaha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 diyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boşvermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3.Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1.Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2.Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2.sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3.Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2.haftanın tamamını, 3.haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3.Haftanın Çarşamba günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1.alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1.aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2.alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2. ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencerlar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencerlar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencerlar\u0026rsquo;a daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphane\u0026rsquo;de Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum.

Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum. Bu haftalık, görüşmek üzere.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"giriş-ve-kısa-bilgilendirme\"\u003eGiriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"merhaba-nedir-bu-devloglar-ve-neden-bu-yazıyı-yazıyorum\"\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum. Bu haftalık, görüşmek üzere.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"giriş-ve-kısa-bilgilendirme\"\u003eGiriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"merhaba-nedir-bu-devloglar-ve-neden-bu-yazıyı-yazıyorum\"\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum. Bu haftalık, görüşmek üzere.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"giriş-ve-kısa-bilgilendirme\"\u003eGiriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"merhaba-nedir-bu-devloglar-ve-neden-bu-yazıyı-yazıyorum\"\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum.

Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum.

Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum. Bu haftalık, görüşmek üzere.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"giriş-ve-kısa-bilgilendirme\"\u003eGiriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"merhaba-nedir-bu-devloglar-ve-neden-bu-yazıyı-yazıyorum\"\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu.

AdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu. Şu anda 4. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisi olmam gerekirdi aslında, ancak ben sistemde ve aslında gerçekten de 3. Sınıf bir Bilgisayar Mühendisliği öğrencisiyim.\nBunun nedeni Erasmus+ ile 9 aylık bir Polonya ve 2 aylık bir İspanya serüveni geçirmiş olmam. Okulu uzattığım için pişman değilim, ancak çok pişman olduğum bir şey var.\nBen üniversite sınavının hemen ardından, henüz daha yerleştirmeler bile açıklanmadan Bilgisayar Mühendisliği alanında çalışmalarıma başlamıştım. Harvard\u0026rsquo;ın CS50 kursuyla birlikte en temelden Bilgisayar Bilimini kavradım, sonrasında Native Android geliştirmeden oyun geliştirmeye, ReactJS projelerinden Flutter\u0026rsquo;a, ve son olarak Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya gidişimle veri bilimine kadar şuan aklıma bile gelmeyen birçok farklı şeyi kurcaladım. Bazılarına haftalar, bazılarına aylar bazılarına yıllar harcadım ve şuan bu yaptıklarımın hiçbirinde ısrarcı olmayıp doğru düzgün belgelememem nedeniyle kendim bile nerede neyle ne seviye ilerlediğimi %100 hatırlayamıyorum.\nUzun lafın kısası, bu durumu değiştirmek adına geliştirdiğimiz AdSphere projesinde hafta hafta neler öğrendiğimi ne sorun yaşadığımı ne kullanarak nasıl çözdüğümü düşünce yapımı ve mühendisliğimi belgelemek ve bu belgelemeden en başta kendim faydalanmak istiyorum. Tüm bu nedenlerle inşallah biz bu projeyi bitirene kadar haftada en az bir yazı paylaşacağım.\nKısaca AdSphere projesi nedir? AdSphere büyük çapta e-ticaret yapan şirketlerin/markaların büyük ölçekli bir biçimde Influencer havuzlarına ulaşmasını, kendi ürün havuzlarıyla kendilerine özel kampanyalar oluşturmalarını, serbest piyasa mantığı ile Influencer\u0026rsquo;ların X kampanyası kapsamında Y ürününe Z fiyatıyla talip olabilmesini amaçlıyor.\nBöylece markalar influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile teklifleşme, havuzdan kendi şirketi ve ürününe uygun influencer seçme, verimsiz sonuçlar aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lar ile tekrar çalışmama, olumlu sonuç aldığı influencer\u0026rsquo;lara daha çok bütçe ayırma gibi lükslere sahip olabilecekler. Yani en azından projenin amacı bu.\nMarka ve Influencer\u0026rsquo;lar arasında köprü olma fikri aklımıza geldikten ve çalışmalara başladıktan yaklaşık 1-2 hafta sonra yaptığımız araştırmada \u0026ldquo;Teamfluencer\u0026rdquo; adında halihazırda hayata geçirilmiş bir proje olduğunu fark ettik. AdSphere fikrinden vazgeçmedik çünkü bu bize fazlasıyla küçük ölçekli ve bu işi el ile tek tek yapan işletmelere yönelik geldi. Bizim fikrimizin halihazırda herhangi bir uygulamanın kaplamadığı alanları kapladığına inandığımızdan projemize devam ediyoruz.\nŞuan Hangi Aşamadayız ve Bu Hafta Neler Yaşandı? Analiz Süreci Yaklaşık üç ay süren derin bir analiz sürecimiz oldu, bu süreçte birçok iş kararı hakkında tartışmalar yaptık. Mentörümüzün de katkılarıyla işe yarar bir yapı ortaya çıkarabildik.\nVeritabanı için tablolarımızı ve ER diyagramımızı ortaya çıkardık. Senaryo(lar) yazdık ve kurduğumuz yapı üzerinden senaryoları veritabanında nasıl gerçekleştiririz bunlara kafa yorduk.\nInfluencer ve Brand taraflarında sırasıyla üç ve dört rol olması gerektiğine karar kıldık ve 7 farklı rolün (aslında 5 diyebiliriz çünkü 2 tanesi tüm rolleri kapsayıcı konumda) farklı işlemlerini göstermesi için \u0026ldquo;Swimlane\u0026rdquo; adında güzel bir diyagram üzerine çalıştık.\nŞimdi ana süreçlerimiz, ve bu süreçlerin altındaki alt süreçler, her süreçte her rolün hangi işlemi hangi mantıkla gerçekleştirebileceği gibi bilgilerin hepsi elimizde güzelce belgelenmiş durumda.\nBunun üzerine mock up olarak ekranlarımızı, ve ekranlarla birlikte de \u0026lsquo;functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non functional\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;cosmetic\u0026rsquo;, ve \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; olmak üzere sınıflandırdığımız 250\u0026rsquo;den fazla gereksinim yazdık.\nYani epey analiz yaptık diyebiliriz, bunun bize geliştirmeye başladığımızda tekrar tekrar ana planda değişiklik yapmama gibi bir lüks sağlayacağına inanıyoruz ve ümit ediyoruz.\nGeliştirme Sürecine Geçişte Neden Bu Kadar Oyalandık? Yaklaşık üç hafta önce analizimiz resmi olarak bittikten sonra hemen geliştirmeye geçmeye karar verdik. Geliştirme için güzel bir mono-repo, containerized yapı kurmaya karar verdim. Ben bu işlemleri yaparken takım arkadaşım İrem de bizim için Figma üzerinden mock-up\u0026rsquo;larımızı tasarımlara dönüştürüyordu.\n1. Hafta İlk hafta yapıyı kurdum; frontend, backend, database ayrı ayrı container\u0026rsquo;lar olarak tek bir docker compose komutu ile sorunsuzca ayağa kalkıp birbirine bağlanıyordu. Frontend uygulamamız Backend\u0026rsquo;e istek gönderiyor, Backend\u0026rsquo;imiz de Database\u0026rsquo;den \u0026lsquo;Selam Dünya\u0026rsquo; değerini alıp Frontend\u0026rsquo;e gönderiyordu. Tüm bu kurulumu Google Cloud Platform üzerinden bir E2 Instance oluşturup uzak sunucuya da kurduk ve test ettik. Yani teknik olarak hem geliştirme yapmaya, hem de haftalık \u0026lsquo;deploy\u0026rsquo;larımıza başlamaya hazırdık.\nİrem bazı tasarımları hazırladı, \u0026lsquo;swimlane\u0026rsquo;de bahsettiğim bir alt süreci gözümüze kestirdik ve bu hafta bunu yapıyoruz dedik.\n2. Hafta Ben bir ikileme düştüm, kodlama yaparken yapay zeka kullanımında ekstrem derecede kısıtlayıcı bir yaklaşımım var. Sanırım yapay zeka yokken kod yazmış en son nesildenim çünkü 1 ve 2. Sınıftayken geliştirdiğim projeler sırasında LLM\u0026rsquo;ler ortada yoktu. Sonrasında olanlar ortada.\nAncak şunu da çok iyi algılıyorum ki hiç yapay zeka kullanmamak da sadece yapay zekaya kod yazdırıp hiçbir şey bilmemekle benzer seviyede başka bir ekstremlik.\nBir hafta boyunca Figma\u0026rsquo;da nasıl efektif şekilde tasarım hazırlarız, oradan LLM\u0026rsquo;in oluşturduğu React projesini kendi projemize \u0026lsquo;kontrollü\u0026rsquo; bir şekilde nasıl taşırız buna kafa yordum. Çünkü ne iş yaptığını algılamadığım bir yapıyı bırakın, tek bir parçayı bile projeme eklemek istemiyorum.\nNihayetinde \u0026lsquo;shadcn/ui\u0026rsquo; kütüphanesi ve \u0026rsquo;tailwindcss\u0026rsquo; ile ilgili takip etmesi gereken kuralları net bir biçimde belirttiğimiz bir \u0026lsquo;prompt\u0026rsquo;u Figma\u0026rsquo;nın \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; kısmından koda dönüştürüp, tüm yapıyı ya da işlevselliği değilse bile ayrı ayrı \u0026lsquo;component\u0026rsquo;ları çekebileceğimiz sonrasında parçaları elimizle birleştirebileceğimiz adım adım takip edilecek bir protokolü oluşturdum ve pratikte test ettim.\nBu ne kadar bir kazanım gibi görünse de bu hafta geliştirmeye başlamalı ve ilk sürecimizi her anlamda tamamlamış olmalıydık.\nAyrıca İrem\u0026rsquo;le birlikte Figma\u0026rsquo;nın Make kısmından yapılan tasarımların birbirine aşırı benzemesi, tam istediğimizi yansıtamaması nedeniyle artık tasarımları en baştan İrem\u0026rsquo;in elle yapmasına karar verdik.\n3. Hafta Yani bu şuan bırakın olmamız gereken yeri, başlayabileceğimiz sıfır noktasından bile gerideydik demek oluyordu. Figma\u0026rsquo;dan projeye nasıl taşırız, tasarımı nasıl yaparız konularıyla 2. Haftanın tamamını, 3. Haftanın da yarısını çöpe atmıştık.\nBurada şunu belirtmeliyim: bizim haftalarımız Cuma günü mesai çıkışında sona eriyor, ve yeni hafta başlıyor. Yani Cuma günleri bizim \u0026lsquo;deployment\u0026rsquo; günlerimiz.\n3. Haftanın Çarşamba Günü Günlük SCRUM\u0026rsquo;lar yapmaya karar vermiştik yani her gün hızlıca, on beş dakika içerisinde hangi işte ne aşamaya geldim ve bugün neye odaklanacağım sorularını cevaplıyorduk.\nBirkaç gündür aksattığımız bu hızlı toplantılardan birini İrem\u0026rsquo;le Mühendislik Fakültesi kantininde yaptık. Kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir ilerleme olmaması iyice gün yüzüne çıkmış oldu. Cuma günü 2 numaralı alt aşamayı bitirmiş olmalıydık ve biz az önce de bahsettiğim gibi ilk aşamaya bile başlama noktasında değil, sıfırın da gerisindeydik.\nHızlı toplantımızın sonunda İrem kütüphaneye gitti ve arayüzlerin tasarımı ile ilgili işine başlayacağını söyledi.\nAslında benim o günkü planım eve gitmekti ancak içim rahat etmedi, tüm bu zaman kaybını ortadan kaldırıp asıl işe başlamamız gerektiğini düşünüyordum bu nedenle yoldan dönüp ben de kütüphaneye gittim. O andan itibaren bizim ekibimiz için HOH Development modeline geçiş başladı ve geliştirmenin 3.haftasının kaderi tamamen değişti.\nHOH Development Modeli Nedir? HOH Nereden Geliyor? 2024 yazında Galatasaray\u0026rsquo;ın orta sahasında geçtiğimiz sezondan kalan ve bir sonraki sezonda hiç randıman vermeyecek olan Sergio Oliveira, Frederik Midtsjo gibi oyuncular vardı. Mükemmel performans veren Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına sağlam, fizikli, ve becerikli bir orta saha oyuncusu aranıyordu. Bu orta saha oyuncusu için kulüp tarihinin en büyük bonservisi verileceği dedikoduları hakimdi, o yüzden epey süre boyunca birçok isim geçti.\nBen de aynı yazın hemen başında Erasmus+ kapsamındaki stajım için Polonya\u0026rsquo;ya gitmiş, iş ortamıma ve yurduma yeni alışırken yalnız olduğum anlarda yürürken ya da bisiklet sürerken YouTube\u0026rsquo;dan bu konu ile ilgili yorumları dinliyordum.\nBu yeni transfer için o kadar isim yazıldı ve iptal oldu ki Uğur Karakullukçu\u0026rsquo;nun kanalındaki canlı yayınlarda artık Galatasaray kadrosu yazılırken Lucas Torreira\u0026rsquo;nın yanına HOH8 yazılıp geçiliyordu.\nBu takıma lazım olan şeyler sıralanırken ve transfer listesi yazılırken HOH8 en başa yazılır, sonra kalan yerlere aday oyuncular doldurulurdu.\nYolda yürürken nedir bu HOH8 deyip durduğumu ve canlı yayının sohbetinde \u0026lsquo;hayvan oğlu hayvan sekiz numara\u0026rsquo; yazısını gördüğümü hatırlıyorum.\nBu arada o yaz bunca kaosun arasında Galatasaray Okan Buruk\u0026rsquo;un çok istediği Scott McTominay yerine Championship\u0026rsquo;ten Gabriel Sara\u0026rsquo;yı getirdi. Bugünlerde McTominay\u0026rsquo;in Napoli\u0026rsquo;de yaptığı şovun ardından bu kararın ne kadar büyük bir rezalet olduğunu daha net görüyoruz.\nKütüphanede Ne Oldu Da Haftanın Kaderi Değişti? Ne kadar hoş bir açılımı olmasa da İrem\u0026rsquo;e \u0026lsquo;HOH Development Modeli\u0026rsquo;ne geçtiğimizi ve başlamak üzere olduğu görevi tamamen boş vermesini istediğimi söyledim. Asıl işimize odaklanıp hızlı hareket etmeye başladık.\nÇarşamba günü İrem veri yapısını oluşturmayı bitirdi, senaryomuzdaki tüm süreci veri yapısı üzerinden başarıyla yürüttüğü bir test gerçekleştirdi.\nBen de dünyanın en düz, dümdüz varsayılan HTML elementlerinden oluşan arayüzümüz ile sadece işlevselliği yürütebileceğimiz şekilde React\u0026rsquo;te basit birkaç sayfa ve component yazdım. Ardından Flask\u0026rsquo;ta ihtiyacımız olan API\u0026rsquo;ları yazmaya başladım.\nÇarşamba akşamı arabamın arızalanmasıyla Perşembe gününün tamamını evde AdSphere üzerinde çalışarak geçireceğim kesinleşmiş oldu.\nPerşembe günü 1. Alt aşamamızın tamamını kurguladım, hangi sayfa hangi API\u0026rsquo;ye istek atacak, hangi API hangi Query\u0026rsquo;i çalıştıracak. Hangi sayfaya geçilecek? Veri yapısı nasıl birbirine uydurulacak? Bu gibi soruların tamamını kurguladım ve çalıştım.\nBu kurguyu kurarken kafam o kadar doluyordu ki pek çok detayı hemen o anda unutabiliyordum. İrem\u0026rsquo;e ondan istediğim Query\u0026rsquo;lerin girdilerini, istediğim çıktıları, hangi API\u0026rsquo;de ne için kullanılacağını, bu API\u0026rsquo;nin hangi sayfalarda kullanılacağı ile ilgili bilgileri aktaran bir PDF yolladım.\nTicket Sistemine Geçiş Yolladığım PDF sayesinde tekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmaktan kurtulduk, ben de bu PDF gibi bir görev \u0026rsquo;template\u0026rsquo;i ile Asana üzerinden İrem için \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar oluşturmaya başladım.\nCuma günü, Perşembe geceye kadar çalıştığımız halde yakaladığımız ivmeyi sürdürmek için sabah 8\u0026rsquo;de ofisteydik. Mesai saatlerinin sonuna kadar 1. Aşamamızın neredeyse her detayını geliştirdik ve test ettik. Bitirmeden önce de oluşan problemlerin her birinin çözümü ile alakalı Asana\u0026rsquo;ya detaylı \u0026rsquo;ticket\u0026rsquo;lar yazdık.\nSürekli olarak \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; kullanmaya, \u0026lsquo;Conflict\u0026rsquo;leri çözmeye, gerçekten hızlı bir biçimde geliştirme yapmaya iyice alıştık.\nTekrar tekrar toplantılar yapmak, neyi nereye nasıl bağlayacağımı unutmak, İrem\u0026rsquo;den istediğim query\u0026rsquo;leri, girdileri, çıktıları, bağlanacakları noktaları unutup durmak yerine Asana üzerinden böyle bir sisteme geçmek bizi hem çok hızlandırdı hem çok rahatlattı.\nArtık sistem mimarisini çok daha rahat bir şekilde kurguluyor ve yürütebiliyoruz.\nÖnümüzdeki Hafta İçin Hedefler ve Plan Ne? Bu haftanın sonunda 2. Alt aşamamızı bitirmiş olmalıydık, şuan buna başlama noktasındayız.\nProjemiz için James Clear\u0026rsquo;ın Atomik Alışkanlıklar kitabında okuduklarım doğrultusunda hedefler koymak ve planlar yapmaya gayret ediyorum.\nNihayetinde yakaladığımız ivmeye ve sistemimize odaklanıyoruz, üç günde karmaşık bir alt aşamayı tamamladık. Aynı ivmeyi sürdürerek önümüzdeki haftanın sonunda nispeten daha az karmaşık olan 2 ve 3. alt aşamaları da tamamlamayı hedefliyoruz.\nHedefimize yönelik bir çalışma ve ivmemiz olduğu için, olduğumuz yere de büyük bir hız ve gelişmeyle geldiğimiz için olumlu hissediyorum. Bu fazlasıyla uzun ve epey gereksiz bilgi barındıran ilk devlog\u0026rsquo;u burada noktalıyorum. Önümüzdeki devlog\u0026rsquo;ların çok daha kısa ve sade olmasını umuyorum. Bu haftalık, görüşmek üzere.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/devlog-adpshere-vol1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"giriş-ve-kısa-bilgilendirme\"\u003eGiriş ve Kısa Bilgilendirme\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"merhaba-nedir-bu-devloglar-ve-neden-bu-yazıyı-yazıyorum\"\u003eMerhaba, nedir bu \u0026lsquo;Devlog\u0026rsquo;lar ve neden bu yazıyı yazıyorum?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdSphere projesi için ve aslında genel olarak da ilk yazdığım devlog bu.

I realized this while I was busy thinking of a topic for my Social Network Analysis assignment.\nMy teammate mentioned this effect and the data of trades on the borders of Netherlands being publicly available. Then I made this investigation further extended by taking the data from United Nations instead of just Netherlands.\nI collected specifically the \u0026lsquo;Avocado\u0026rsquo; export data of 248 countries (utilizing the UN49 country codes). I used a basic python for loop and lots of waiting for not spamming the public API limit.\nThe limit for output was 500 countries yet, there aren\u0026rsquo;t 500 countries on the list anyways. So, I just did the scraping and addition iteratively over 248 countries. Here are the things to learn from this data and further observations of mine during this assignment.\nWhat is this Rotterdam Effect? Basically, it is the economic illusion where a country appears to be a massive producer of a good, not because they actually grow or make it, but because they have a massive port.\nIn this case, the Port of Rotterdam.\nWhen I looked at the CSV file I generated from my Python script, the numbers were confusing at first. The Netherlands was sitting right near the top of the \u0026ldquo;Global Avocado Exporters\u0026rdquo; list, shoulder-to-shoulder with actual tropical giants like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\nBut here is the catch: The Netherlands has a cold, maritime climate. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t growing avocados there.\nThis is the Rotterdam Effect in action. Huge shipments of avocados arrive from the Global South into the Port of Rotterdam. They get unloaded, perhaps ripened in a warehouse, packaged, and then \u0026ldquo;re-exported\u0026rdquo; to Germany, France, or the UK.\nWhy this matters for my SNA Graph This observation completely changes how I have to interpret the network graph.\nIf I just plot the nodes (countries) and edges (trade flows) blindly, the Netherlands will have an incredibly high Betweenness Centrality. It looks like a central authority or a source in the avocado network.\nBut in reality, it’s just a massive logistics hub. It’s a pass-through node, not a source node.\nWhat are Takeaways Then? Honestly, Mexico being the leader is something we all expect as they are selling to the entire North America, that is normal. But the thing that is actually very interesting in the 2024 data is the performance of Netherlands. Even though they don\u0026rsquo;t have any production of their own due to their climate, they are ranking as the 3rd largest exporter in the world. They are basically acting like the \u0026lsquo;supermarket of Europe.\u0026rsquo; This proves that controlling the logistics and supply chain is almost as profitable as owning the production processes.\nCredits Thanks to the Cover Photo by Melvin Chavez\nData is taken by UN Comtrade Database\nShout-out to Mete Han YILMAZ for his initial idea of Avocados + Netherlands Customs Data\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/til-rotterdam-effect/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"today-i-learned\"\u003eToday I Learned\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat there is this thing called \u0026ldquo;Rotterdam Effect\u0026rdquo; in the literature.
