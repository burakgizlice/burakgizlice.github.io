### 📦 What is this place?
While my other pages are for *thinking out loud*, this page is for **results**. 
It’s a collection of concrete outcomes—projects that have left the draft stage, survived the bugs, and are now sitting on the shelf, finished.

### 🏗️ What you'll find
I categorize my output into three main pillars:
* **Community:** Building ecosystem and culture (like **NEXUS**).
* **Academia:** My research papers and technical theory.
* **Engineering:** Software projects that are deployed, done, and dusted.
