## 👋 Hi again!
I am a **3rd Grade Computer Engineering student at ALKÜ**.  
I work as a Lead Developer and Community Manager.  
My background started with Data Engineering and Frontend, and grew into **full-stack and product-oriented engineering**.  

I focus on practical solutions, not hype. I design data models, manage cloud servers, build full-stack apps, and guide teams to ship working products.
